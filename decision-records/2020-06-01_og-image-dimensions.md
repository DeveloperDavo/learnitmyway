# og:image dimensions

It is recommended [by Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/best-practices#images) to set an `og:image:width` and `height` so the crawler doesn't have to download the images asynchronously. However, I have decided it's not worth the effort doing this for every image.
