At the very beginning, it was quite challenging to convince my future employers that I, with my Master of Structural Engineering, was the right person for the job as a software engineer.  This is how I made it happen.

**I knew exactly <a href="http://learnitmyway.com/2016/08/10/why-i-changed-careers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why I wanted to change careers</a>.** I conveyed this in every cover letter, at careers fairs and in interviews. I figured if I could convince myself then I could convince my future employer.

**I presented all the relevant experience I had.** For me, it was the engineering background and former work experience as a consultant. I also listed [learning material][1] in <a href="http://localhost/learnitmyway/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/developer-davo-cv4.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my CV</a> and created a <a href="https://github.com/DeveloperDavo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub profile</a> to offer some proof that I had completed or was in the middle of completing further education. (I should add that my list of learning material and my GitHub profile had a lot less to show back in 2015!). I wish I had this blog back then as well!

**I went to a career fair with the goal to learn as much as I could about each company that was there.** I actually went there looking for a job as a structural engineer and just for fun I decided to get to know the IT companies that were there as well. It was only afterwards that I made the decision to become a software developer.

At the career fair, I got to know three IT companies and applied at all three, and got an interview at all three. For the first company, I passed the first interview but I didn’t pass the programming exercise. The second company offered me an internship for three months with one day off to study and the third company offered me a permanent position. I took the internship because I knew the day off would be a great opportunity to bridge my knowledge gap quicker. The happy ending to this story is that the same company offered me a permanent position, which I started straight after completing my internship.
