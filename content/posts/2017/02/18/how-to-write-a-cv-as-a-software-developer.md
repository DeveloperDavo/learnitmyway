After applying my <a href="http://learnitmyway.com/2017/01/31/how-to-network-as-a-software-developer/" target="_blank">tips on networking</a>, it was time to apply for a job. In this article I would like to share my tips on writing a CV. Since so many of you have asked, here is <a href="http://localhost/learnitmyway/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/developer-davo-cv4.pdf" target="_blank">my CV</a> that lead to a job offer!

**Tip 1: Showcase your tech stack. **The easiest way to do this is to list the stack under a previous project that you have worked on. Another way is to showcase your projects on <a href="https://github.com/DeveloperDavo/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I also included a section in my CV called &#8220;self study&#8221; where I listed courses, books and podcasts that I have used to <a href="http://learnitmyway.com/2016/11/11/learning-material-software-development/" target="_blank">teach myself about software development</a>. Keep in mind I didn&#8217;t include the whole list, only those that I thought were necessary for the position I was applying for.

**Tip 2: Use Action verbs to demonstrate your experience. **Examples include: &#8220;applied&#8221;, &#8220;improved&#8221;, &#8220;implemented&#8221; (<a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/administration-and-support-services/careers-service/public/resources/handouts/series/How-to-write-a-CV-no-cropmarks.pdf" target="_blank">Imperial College in London has a more extensive list</a>). An example of what was in my CV from the end of 2016 is: &#8220;Ensured quality with unit and integration tests and applying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">TDD</a>&#8220;.

**Tip 3: Tailor your CV to the position you are applying for**. This means your CV might differ for each job application you have! I like to proofread my CV (many times) and only focus on weeding out what isn&#8217;t necessary for each job I am applying for. As an example, I recently applied for a job that mentioned <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Code" target="_blank">clean code</a> in the job ad so under a section called &#8220;self study&#8221; I included  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code" target="_blank">Clean Code by Robert Martin</a>.

**Tip 4: Include your interests.** This will give you something to talk about during the interview and it is your chance to show a bit of personality. Be specific if you can. For example in my CV I have &#8220;reading fantasy and non-fiction&#8221;. I actually recently got asked at different interviews, which book I was reading. (For those of you who are interested, I was reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18966806-morning-star?from_search=true" target="_blank">Morning Star</a> at the time and it was awesome!)
