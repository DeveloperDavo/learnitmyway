After applying my <a href="http://learnitmyway.com/2017/01/31/how-to-network-as-a-software-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tips on networking</a> and <a href="http://learnitmyway.com/2017/02/18/how-to-write-a-cv-as-a-software-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing a CV</a> I completed each job application with its own cover letter and this resulted in being invited to various interviews.

In this article I would like to share my tips on writing a cover letter. To get the most out it I would recommend reading [my cover letter][1], which is the one I used for my application at Forty2. (This is not the company&#8217;s real name.)

**Tip1: Start with how you got to know the company. **This will make the cover letter a lot more personal and not just the same cover letter you send out to hundreds of companies. Example: &#8220;After looking at your website, which I discovered on glassdoor.com, I got the impression that Forty2 is a modern and dynamic company that enjoys taking on challenges.&#8221;

**Tip 2: Describe relevant experiences and what you learned from them. **Anyone can list their skills in a cover letter but a more effective cover letter is one that describes your experiences. Example: &#8220;In this project I have been able to learn how to write code efficiently in a team, improve legacy code and implement new features according to the client’s needs.&#8221;

**Tip 3: Show your enthusiasm.** Enthusiasm leads to motivation and motivation leads to results. If you&#8217;re applying for a position as an Android developer an example would be &#8220;My passion for Android development started when&#8230;&#8221;

**Tip 4: Try to use the company&#8217;s name as often as you can. **This adds to the personal touch that  your cover letter started with in tip 1. Example: &#8220;I would like to improve on these skills and learn new ones with Forty2&#8221;

**Tip 5: End strongly. **If you have already described your experiences (tip 2) and shown your enthusiasm (tip 3) ** **sum up your cover letter with the strengths and enthusiasm you have portrayed. Don&#8217;t forget to name the company (tip 4) and the position you are applying for once again. Example: &#8220;With my determination, passion for software development and ability to adapt to new situations, I believe I am a good candidate as an Android developer at Forty2.&#8221;
