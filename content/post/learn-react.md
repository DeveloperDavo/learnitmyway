_In this article, I share a list of the recommended resources that have helped me learn React._

<!--more-->

I highly recommend learning React. I was first exposed to it early 2018 for a project at work and it has grown to become the technology I am most familiar with.

## Assumed Knowledge

Before starting with these resources you should have some experience with JavaScript.
In particular, you should feel comfortable using ES6 syntax (eg. arrow functions and classes).
Trying these resources before you are familiar with JavaScript will just frustrate you.
If you feel that you are lacking some (or a lot of) knowledge I would recommend having a look
at <a href="https://www.learnitmyway.com/learn-javascript-with-these-resources/" target="_blank"
rel="noopener">Learn JavaScript with these resources</a>.
Otherwise, the resources below can be completed in the order they are given. Enjoy!

### Getting started

**<a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/yes-react-is-taking-over-front-end-development-the-question-is-why-40837af8ab76" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yes, React is taking over front-end development. The question is why. - Samer Buna</a>**

- A nice introduction to React
- Length: 14 minutes

**<a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tutorial: Intro To React - Official Documentation</a>**

- Learn React by implementing tic-tac-toe with time travel
- Make sure you do the improvements at the end! You are welcome to compare your solutions with <a href="https://github.com/DeveloperDavo/intro-to-react-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mine</a>.

**<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hello World - Official Documentation</a>**

- Start by implementing the example in <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thinking in React</a>
  on your own and then read the documentation from the beginning. This will show you where your gaps are.
- I would recommend coming back to the advanced guide once you have a bit more practice with React.

## Practice

Once you have completed the resources above I would recommend practising the concepts by starting a project of your own. It can be something similar to
<a href="https://github.com/DeveloperDavo/my-movies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Movies</a>, which is a project I started for the same reason.

## Testing

It can be a little overwhelming learning how to test before you have had any practice but that is not a reason to forget them altogether! A nice place to get started is the [official Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started), which is very well written.

**[React Testing Examples](https://react-testing-examples.com/)**

- This can be used to get started or for some inspiration
- Examples are in [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) and [React Testing Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-testing-library)
