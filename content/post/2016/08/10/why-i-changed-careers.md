excerpt: 
    The number one question I got asked in interviews before changing careers is why I decided to change 
    from structural to software engineering. In this post I share my reasons why.

A long story short, I started programming for the first time in 2015 whilst completing my master’s thesis in Germany. 
I was required to write an algorithm for a mathematical model, which I enjoyed so much that I decided to take a break 
after completing my degree and teach myself computer science before committing to a job. It very quickly became 
apparent that this is the direction I wanted my career to go in and I have five reasons for making that change.

<p style="padding-left:30px;">
  <strong>1. The amount of innovation happening</strong><br /> 
  With the opportunities available to us to today it has never been easier for people to make and learn new things. 
  Examples that come to mind are self-driving cars and augmented reality. 
  Developing software brings me closer to this excitement and also keeps my brain fit so I can keep up with a world 
  that is changing exponentially.
</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">
  <strong>2. The ability to see the results of your hard work</strong><br /> 
  By this I mean the feeling every developer gets when they get a new feature working and get to see results 
  almost instantaneously. One of the first times I experienced this was when I got a basic version of my algorithm 
  working for my <a href="https://github.com/DeveloperDavo/Paperboard" target="_blank">thesis</a>. I remember writing 
  loads of spaghetti code with no idea about design and after fiddling around a bit I clicked on ‘plot’ and a graph 
  popped up on the screen depicting my results. Believe me, this was a really exciting moment :).
</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">
  <strong>3. The ability to apply what you learn straight after learning it</strong><br /> 
  There have been numerous occasions where I have read, watched or listened to something new
  and I am able to apply this at work or in my own projects. 
  An example is <a href="https://github.com/DeveloperDavo/DesignPatterns" target="_blank">design patterns</a>. 
  As soon as you are able to use and recognise them programming becomes a lot more elegant.
</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">
  <strong>4. The team and work atmosphere that we are exposed to</strong><br /> 
  With Agile processes such as Scrum and Extreme Programming, teams are able to work extremely effectively. 
  As a result, individual members are able to learn more, the team is able to interact better with one another 
  and productivity increases dramatically.
</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">
  <strong>5. The people that are attracted to the profession</strong><br /> 
  There are so many good and inspiring developers out there that are genuinely interested in helping others. 
  Just have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/trending" target="_blank">trending open source projects on GitHub</a>.
</p>

So those are the reasons I made the change. I don't regret the decision at all and can highly recommend doing it.
