Towards the beginning of my career, I consumed a lot of content on writing maintainable code, career tips and object orientated programming. Some of the resources I have even revisited. This list contains the ones worth recommending.

<!--more-->

## Assumed Knowledge

To get the most out of these resources you should be comfortable with at least one object orientated programming language and be interested in a career developing software.

If you feel you need to brush up on some of your Java skills for some of the resources I would recommend [Learn Java with these Resources](https://learnitmyway.com/2017/07/02/learn-java-with-these-resources/), which are the resources I used and recommend.

## Resources

The following resources can be consumed at any time and in any order.

### [Clean Code - Bob Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code)

One of the classics, this book gets you thinking in the right direction when it comes to designing software that is reusable, maintainable, flexible and scalable. I found the explanation of TDD to be particularly useful.

- **Type**: Book
- **Length**: ~250 pages
- **Language**: Java
- **Note**: I skipped chapters >= 16
- **My key take-aways**:
  - later = never
  - comments tend to a lie after a while
  - unit tests make our code more flexible
  - write dirty code and then clean in

### [Clean Code Video Series - Bob Martin](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/clean-code/9780134661742/)

After reading Clean Code I can highly recommend watching the video series to make the lessons more concrete, especially
the videos on TDD.

- **Type**: Video
- **Length**: ~1 hour per video with 10+ videos
- **Language**: Java
- **Note**: I skipped the astronomy segments at the beginning of each lesson and the episodes on architecture and BDD.

### [Clean Coder - Bob Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10284614-the-clean-coder?from_search=true)

### [Head First Design Patterns - E. Freeman et al.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58128.Head_First_Design_Patterns)

This is a great book for learning about design patterns, design principles and object orientated programming. I wrote my own examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/DeveloperDavo/DesignPatterns) to help me consolidate the material.
