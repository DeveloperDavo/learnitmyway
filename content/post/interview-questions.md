Over the course of my career I have interviewed with 20+ companies for junior, senior and lead positions and I would like to share the questions that keep coming up. To make the questions easier to follow I have named the company FakeForty2 (which is not a real company!)

TODO: refer to crucial conversations

### Would you like to give us a summary of your career so far?

From experience, this is often the first question that get's asked in an interview as it is a good opportunity to make the candidate at ease. **Pro tip**: It really helps to read your own CV beforehand as it will make it much easier to answer this question. I always regret not doing it.

### What is your understanding of what we do at FakeForty2?

This is an opportunity for FakeForty2 to get to know what impression they have made outside of the company and it also allows them to fill any gaps in your knowledge. Don’t forget to research the company beforehand!

### What made you decide to become a software developer?

This question to naturally comes towards the beginning of the interview. In [my very first blog article](https://learnitmyway.com/2016/08/10/why-i-changed-careers/), I share my reasons for doing it, if you need any ideas.

### What is a recent (technical) challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?

My advice here would be to pick something that required you to learn something new. For example: "In order to understand why there was no error propagation, I had to research how GraphQL handles errors." If you don't have many previous experiences you could describe what you needed to learn to complete a recent project.

Another tip: Try generalising the problem in a way that doesn't require too much context. If you are using acronyms specific to the business domain of your previous project your interviewer might not be able to follow you.

### Has there ever been a time where you have had to compromise quality to release software on time? 

I like to answer this question by describing a situation where I have knowingly introduced [tech debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt). This could be something simple like not adding a test because you had already spent an hour on it and weren't able to make it work. Or it could be avoiding error handling because the feedback from users was obviously more important than not confusing the users. You could even admit to deliberately introducing obvious duplication in order to meet a deadline. I think it's also important to stress that compromising quality now results in slower delivery time in the future and it always depends on the situation.

### Tell me about a time you received (constructive) feedback from your supervisor/teacher/mentor

Alternative: What are you strengths/weaknesses?

constructive -> how you deal with it

7. What are your strengths and weaknesses? I am not really convinced that this question is worth asking but I have encountered “and when/how does your [weakness] express itself?” as a follow-up question. This is difficult to answer if you haven’t prepared for it! My advice would be to think of three strengths that you have and three weaknesses (that aren’t going to destroy your job chances) and then move on.
8. What is your expected salary / What are you getting paid now? These questions are slightly different from one another but they both involve negotiating your salary so I have counted it as one question. I would recommend thinking about how (and when) you would like to answer this question. Sometimes this question even get’s asked before the interview. I would also recommend having a look at Learn how to improve with these resources where I summarise Never Split the Difference, a book that helped improve my negotiation skills. TODO: don't admit your current salary
