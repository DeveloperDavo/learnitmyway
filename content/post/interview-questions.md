Over the course of my career I have interviewed with 20+ companies for junior, senior and lead positions and I would like to share the questions that keep coming up. To make the questions easier to follow I have named the company FakeForty2 (which is not a real company!)

## Questions

### Would you like to give us a summary of your career so far?

From experience, this is often the first question that get's asked in an interview as it is a good opportunity to make the candidate at ease. It really helps to read your own CV beforehand as it will make it much easier to answer this question. I always regret not doing it.

### What is your understanding of what we do at FakeForty2?

This is an opportunity for FakeForty2 to get to know what impression they have made outside of the company and it also allows them to fill any gaps in your knowledge. Don’t forget to research the company beforehand! Some things you could research include the company's products, leadership team and values. It can also sometimes help to look at company rating sites such as [glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com) to get an impression from (former) employees. 

### What made you decide to become a software developer?

This question to naturally comes towards the beginning of the interview. In [my very first blog article](https://learnitmyway.com/2016/08/10/why-i-changed-careers/), I share my reasons for doing it, if you are looking for some inspiration.

### What is a recent (technical) challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?

My advice here would be to pick something that required you to learn something new. For example: "In order to understand why there was no error propagation, I had to research how GraphQL handles errors." If you don't have many previous experiences you could describe what you needed to learn to complete a recent project.

Another tip: Try generalising the problem in a way that doesn't require too much context. If you are using acronyms specific to the business domain of your previous project your interviewer might not be able to follow you.

### Has there ever been a time where you have had to compromise quality to release software on time?

I like to answer this question by describing a situation where I have knowingly introduced [tech debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt). This could be something simple like not adding a test because I had already spent an hour on it and wasn't able to make it work. Or it could be avoiding error handling because the feedback from users was obviously more important than not confusing the users. You could even admit to deliberately introducing obvious duplication in order to meet a deadline. I think it's also important to stress that compromising quality in the present results in slower delivery time in the future. Don't forget to mention that it always depends on the situation!

### Tell me about a time you received (constructive) feedback from your supervisor/mentor/teacher/friend

Alternative: What are you strengths/weaknesses?

This is an opportunity for you to share your strengths, if you received positive feedback, or something that you have improved upon after receiving constructive feedback. The actions you took after receiving constructive feedback might even make a better impression than sharing any positive feedback you have received. If you are struggling to think of how to answer this question it might be a good time to gather some feedback. For example, you could send out an email to anyone who has worked or studied with you and ask: "What did I do well?" and "What could I improve upon?"

Just in case you directly get asked what your strengths and/or weaknesses are, it might be a good idea to prepare three strengths and three weaknesses.

### What is your expected/desired salary?

Alternative: What are you currently getting paid?

I would recommend thinking about how (and when) you would like to answer this question. Sometimes this question even get’s asked before the interview. From the research I have done it seems that is best to mention a range that you would like to earn within a year, with your desired salary at the beginning of the range. For example if you would like to earn 50 000 a year you could say: "I would like to earn between 50 and 55". From experience, it also helps to ask: "Does that fit in your range?" If it doesn't fit in their range, it will be an opportunity for you both to discuss it. If the range does fit in the company's range, you will know that you haven't aimed too high.

If you get asked what you are currently getting paid, I would recommend not answering it as this might put you at a disadvantage. In order to avoid answering it you could say: "I would prefer not to say". If they are really pushy, you could admit that you don't feel comfortable disclosing it or that you are not allowed to, as your current employer wouldn't want you to share it either!
